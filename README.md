Subject: Completion Update: PCF to OpenShift Migration – Challenges and Resolutions

Dear Team,

I would like to provide you with an update regarding the PCF to OpenShift migration and highlight some of the key challenges we encountered and how we addressed them.

During the migration process, we faced multiple technical hurdles:
	1.	Snapshot Build Issues:
The SNAPSHOT build was not getting generated from the code repository created using the IDP tool. To resolve this, we modified the CICD YAML files and updated the docker image configurations in the poc-ocp branch. Additionally, helm charts were manually updated to align with the new deployment requirements.
	2.	Harness Deployment Failures:
Harness deployments were failing whenever there were issues in the SNAPSHOT build, with the following warning:
[opaworkloadpolicy] WORKLOAD-01: Deployment brt-dev/app-brt-art-dev-deploy - workload automountServiceAccountToken=true.
	3.	Tomcat Startup Issues:
The Tomcat server was not coming up due to the presence of a legacy cookie processor configuration in the context.xml. After removing this configuration, Tomcat was able to start successfully.
	4.	X509 Certificate Errors:
There were X509 certificate errors, which we resolved by upgrading the cloud-tis dependency in the build.gradle file from version 2.20 to 2.8.0.
	5.	Context Path Configuration Issues:
After getting Tomcat up and running, the application was still not accessible due to context path issues. Since ART leverages an external Tomcat, we explored multiple solutions, including:
	•	Adding external Tomcat configuration files as per the confluence guidelines.
	•	Modifying the context path in both tomcatCustomServerXml and customStartScript-externaltomcat YAML files.
	•	Adjusting values.yaml and deployment YAML files accordingly.
After several iterations, we were finally able to access the application’s secure login page, and authentication was successful.
We also submitted a request to whitelist the ART URL:
https://art-dev2.apps.lew08.ocp.nonprod.wellsfargo.net/art/login/oauth2/code/pingin.
	6.	Namespace Requests:
We have already raised requests for namespace creation for SIT, UAT, and PFIX environments. Once DEV is fully validated, we will proceed with deployments to these additional environments.
	7.	Docker Image Upgrade:
Currently, we are using the docker image utilities-containerimages-tomcat:9.0-java17. Since we have migrated to Java 17 + Tomcat 10, we will be updating the image to:
utilities-containerimages-tomcat:10.0-java17.
	8.	Pending Updates:
The remaining task is to modify the hashicorp vault configurations in the values.yaml file. I will complete this and provide you with a further update once it is done.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
